Until this project becomes stable enough to be run off a Makefile, the Eclipse MBS structure
will have to suffice.

What this means:
The vgp library requires a symbolic link at /usr/local/include/vgp pointing to the vgp project
directory. This allows vgp header files to access each other. Programs using vgp should also
refer to the library through the above symbolic link.

Once this library matures to a Makefile system, the library will be 'installed' at the above
mentioned location.
